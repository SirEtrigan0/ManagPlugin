Multi-purpous Server Plugin

Hello there good people!
My name is Marek and here I present 3 days of my hard work.
It's a custom made plugin for my and my friends' server.
This plugin was made with Spigot 1.21.3 in mind (Snapshot version at the moment of writing {05.12.2024}),
has 4 plugins inside it. The reason for that is preaty funny. The hosting that my friend has chosen has a limit
of 5 plugins, so I got to take matters into my own hand and made 4 plugins and then connected them into this monstrsity.

It features:
  ManagePlugin:
  
    - Custom /sethome and /home command
    
    - You need to pay one diamond per /home command
    
    - /sethome command is free
  Stonemaker:
  
    - Easy to craft block that generates stone block above itself
    
    - It just generates stone, nothing fancy
    
    - Some of this code was 'borrowed' from somewhere else :)
    
    - Inspired by old polsish minecraft servers like mchc.pl (from 2015/16/17)
    
  Obsidianmaker:
  
    - Same stuff like the stone maker but it generates obsidian
    
  Teleporter:
  
    - Custom made plugin for crafting teleporters
    
    - Easy to use
    
    - Little bit buggy but I'll fix it ASAP
    
    - You need two teleports with the same name
    
    - You name them with a name tag.
    
    - Just click with RMB on the placed block
    
    - More features soon...
